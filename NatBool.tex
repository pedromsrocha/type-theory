\section{Introducing naturals and booleans}

In this section we extend SLTC to consider integer and boolean expressions. We also augment the previous type system accordingly. Then we prove that actually we do not need them. That is, we can express integers and booleans within the lambda calculus itself. From that, results such as the determinacy of $\to$ and type safety follow easily.
